What we have learned:
	1.Comprehensions can process more than one input sequence
	2.Compreshensions work like nested for loops.
	3.Later clauses in comprehension can access variables bound before.
	4.Can contain if staements.

	5.Map calls a function for each element in its input sequence
	6.Map returns an iterable object not a fully evaluated collection
	7.Map results are lazily evalulated Meaning you must evaluate yourself.
	8.You must provide as mnay input sequences to map as the callable object has params.

	9.Filter selects values from an input sequence which match a specified criteria.
	10.Filter passes each input as argument
	11.Also produces output lazily.

	12.Reduce culmativley applies a function to the elements of an input sequence.
	13.Calls the input function with 2 args, the result of previous and next element.
	14.Can add optional initial arg

	15. Iterator Protocol:
		next(iterator)     iterator.__next__()

	16. Iterable Protocol:
		iter(iterable)    iterable.__iter__()
						  iterable.__getitem__(index)
