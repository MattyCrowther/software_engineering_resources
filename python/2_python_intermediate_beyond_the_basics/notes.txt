Modules and Packages:
   A module usually means a single source file
   A package is a special module which contains other modules.
   Packages are generally directories
   Modules are generally single files
   
   When a Module is imported uses sys.path

   The PYTHONPATH enviroment variable listing paths added to sys.path
   So Basically just export PYTHONPATH=whateverpackagename and it will be added to searchdir 


__nAME___
   The __ means standard names.

   
self or this
   this must always be in the constructor of a class, self is not a keyword can be called anything, works the same as this in java
