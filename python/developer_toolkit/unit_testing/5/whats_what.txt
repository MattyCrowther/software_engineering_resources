The generic term he uses is a Test Double (think stunt double). Test Double is a generic term for any case where you replace a production object for testing purposes.


Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill 	parameter lists.

Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an InMemoryTestDatabase is a good example).

Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.

Spies are stubs that also record some information based on how they were called. One form of this might be an email service that records how many messages it was sent.

Mocks are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. They can throw an exception if they receive a call they don't expect and are checked during verification to ensure they got all the calls they were expecting.


Extra:
MonkeyPatching -
Monkey patching is reopening the existing classes or methods in class at runtime and changing the behavior, which should be used cautiously, or you should use it only when you really need to. As Python is a dynamic programming language, Classes are mutable so you can reopen them and modify or even replace them
