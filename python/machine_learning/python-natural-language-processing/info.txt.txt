Natural language processing - Natural-language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, 
in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language data.
Challenges in natural-language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.

 Basis of NLP:
1) Tokenization - 	            Breaking down text into words and sentences.
2) Stop word removal -         	    Remove connecting words such as the and it that dont provide much information.
3) N-Grams -           	            Identify commonly occuring groups of words.
4) Word sense Disambiguation -      Identiying the context in which the word occurs.
5) Parts of Speech -                Identifying if a word is a noun, verb etc.
6) Stemming -                       Remove end of words if have no meaning ie close and closed can get rid of d.


Auto-summarizing / Abstract Extraction - The idea of being able to summarize a body of text.
1)Rertrieve Text   - Download and parse the text from webpage
2)Preprocess Text  - Tokenize text into sentences and or words, Remove stopwords.
3)Extract sentenses - Compute frequencies of words, Compute significance scores of sentences, Rank sentences.

Classifying text using machine learning
1)Start with large num of articles.
2)Identify underlying themes.
3)Assign themes to new articles.
