MNIST Data:
70,000 data points
55,000 for training
10,000 for test
5,000 for validation

Each data point contains 28x28 greyscale image
Label - the digit, 0-9

Helper routines on tensorflow site (we using these).

Process:

Prepare Data - MNIST Data
inference- sum(x*weight) + bias -> activation
Loss measurment - Cross Entropy
Optimize to Minimize loss -  Gradient Descent Optimiser.

What was wrong with SimpleMNIST:

Lost any notion we was using images
